**Conclusion**
After categorizing the customers into segments, we found that.
- Champions. There are no top category customers left in the store who place orders regularly and for high amounts.
- Loyal customers. 25.9% of customers belong to the loyal segment. It is possible to develop strategies to retain them and move some of these customers to the champion segment. For example, you can send them exclusive offers, develop a loyalty reward system.
- Potential customers. 16.4% of customers. These are customers who have made some number of orders, but have not yet formed a permanent activity. Here it is possible to conduct targeted marketing campaigns, develop special offers
- Lost customers. 57.7% of clients belong to the category of lost clients. This means that they have not made orders for more than 4 months. We remember that it was in May 2019 that there was a collapse in sales, both in terms of revenue and orders. It may be possible to get some of these customers back by reminding them and conducting an engagement campaign.
