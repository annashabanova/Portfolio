**Conclusion**:
Based on the analysis, it's clear that the advertising campaign showed promising results in countries other than the US. The US campaign, however, proved inefficient, largely due to high spending on unprofitable channels. To improve ROI, it's recommended to reallocate investments to more efficient channels like RocketSuperAds, YRabbit, and MediaTornado. Additionally, careful consideration is advised for the FaceBoom channel due to its high costs and retention rate issues. Finally, discontinuing the TipTop channel is advised due to its consistently rising costs. This strategic shift is crucial for optimizing advertising efforts and maximizing profitability.
