## Conclusion
the new recommendation system did not lead to an improvement of the metrics

There were a number of factors that may have affected the conduct and results of the test. 
One of the main factors is the lack of complete data on user actions.

**Recommendation**: re-run the test as it was stopped 5 days early and there is a possibility that there was a "peeking problem".
