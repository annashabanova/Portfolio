## Research objective
to assess the correctness of the test and analyse its results


## Skills & Tools
- python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- plotly.express
- graph_objects
- numpy
- proportions_ztest

## Conclusion
the new recommendation system did not lead to an improvement of the metrics

There were a number of factors that may have affected the conduct and results of the test. 
One of the main factors is the lack of complete data on user actions.

**Recommendation**: re-run the test as it was stopped 5 days early and there is a possibility that there was a "peeking problem".
